# internet-radio-streams

My goal is to make a cool github with a listing of internet radio station streams.

Feel free to fork, add listings, and submit pull requests!

I don't have a lot of preferences for how to list streams, but here's what
I do care about:

* Please make an m3u and a pls for each stream.
* Please try to find some logical way to group your stations - for
  instance, I've made an 'iheartradio' directory.
* If you write a script or anything to make your playlists, please
  include that, too.

My initial commit is a listing of all the iHeartRadio stations - take a look at
`generate_iheartradio` as a (poor) example.

## Current Sets

* `iheartradio` - a listing of all iHeartRadio stations. Contains subdirectories for grouping by callletters and by station name.
* `somafm` - a listing of all the SomaFM stations.
* `independent` - a listing of independent stations
* `digitallyimported` - Digitally imported playlists
